This project simulates a simple queueing system to analyze various performance metrics such as 
average turnaround time, total throughput, average CPU utilization, and average processes in the ready queue. 
The simulation takes two parameters as input: the average arrival rate (in arrivals per second) and the average service time (in seconds). 
These parameters are provided via command-line arguments when running the program.



To run program 
first compile with: 		 g++ -o simulation Main.cpp
then you can either run with:	 ./simulation 
or 				 ./simulation arg1 arg2

I included default values of lambda = 10 and average service time of .04 seconds 
such that it is possible to run the code without arguments.
